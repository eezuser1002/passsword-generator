This script generates a password using your first/last name and random special chars. The output should be your first name and some random chars, you can specify the length of your pw.

If you're on a linux/MacOS machine, Python 2.7 will likely be installed by default. Don't be tempted to run this using Python2.7, use the new and improved Python3. Backwards compatibility to Python 2.7 will be discussed in the future. For now, stick to Python3 :)
